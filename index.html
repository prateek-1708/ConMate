<p>One of the most cumbersome things to maintain in any project is application / infrastructure configuration. Although infrastructure configuration should not be maintained in project, sometimes it is lot easier to do that. Now application configuration could be something that application needs at runtime. If we think about it, application itself sounds like the best place to store such configs ? isn't it ? Unfortunately it's a BAD IDEA !!</p>

<a id="bad-idea-" class="anchor" href="#bad-idea-" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>BAD IDEA ?</h3>

<p>Now why is that so ? Firstly it's a massive security risk if nothing else. On the other hand (if you follow standard build process) a change in config requires a version bump, full application build and then deploy. This is (what I like to call) tight coupling between application and runtime. This also means application needs to be aware of its runtime. </p>

<p>Nothing to loose sleep over. There is simple solution viz etcd (at-c-d). You can read all about etcd <a href="https://coreos.com/etcd/">here</a></p>

<p>ConMate is a very very lightweight php utility to connect to etcd. ConMate can be used in any application to fetch configs from etcd. It does not depend on any other library as of now. But things may change in future.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/prateek-1708" class="user-mention">@prateek-1708</a> is the only contributor at this point in time. This library is in it's early infancy at the moment. There is a lot work that still needs to be done.</p>
